# BFS vs DFS

As Ruby has no built-in [tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) object, I wrote my own Node class which can have a value, a parent, and multiple children. I also wrote methods for searching within a tree: my [BFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) method is iterative, while my [DFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) method is recursive. The code  includes a speed-comparison function for these two methods, and comes with two pre-constructed trees, each containing 14 nodes.
