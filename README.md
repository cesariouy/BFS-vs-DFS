# BFS vs DFS

As Ruby has no built-in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure" target="_blank">tree</a> object, I wrote my own Node class which can have a value, a parent, and multiple children. I also wrote methods for searching within a tree: my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank">breadth-first</a> method is iterative, while my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" target="_blank">depth-first</a> method is recursive. The code  includes a speed-comparison function for these two methods, and comes with two pre-constructed trees, each containing 14 nodes.
